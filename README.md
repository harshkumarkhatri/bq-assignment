# breakq_assignment

A flutter project related to assignment for BreakQ company.

Some key points:

This project has two layout which are given below.
* Layout 1
    - Layout 1 has all the items are being fetched from the api provided.
    - Drawer is displaying demo items which are available as a default on flutter doc.
* Layout 2
    - Layout 2 has details related to the item which you have clicked on.
    - Cart is not functional. It is displaying constant string.
* There are 3 apks which have been generated to avoid a fat apk which has binaries which are not useful for the user. You can find the apks in the 'application apk' folder.
* For route management, i have used Getx.

**Note**: I have removed the api link from the code as it is not advisable to add the api's to the code while pushing it to github. App has the api implemented in it.
